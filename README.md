# Initial-DNN-Trainer

This project is a very "proof-of-concept" work. With plenty of uncommented code, debug statements, and generally unpolished features, this project is by no means my attemt at a finalized product. I hope to continue this project in the future.

To run the project for yourself, download the source code and run

-python main.py
